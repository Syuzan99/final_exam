# final_exam
Final exam from python/django
My final exam will involve creating a platform where customers can book appointments for beauty services and specialist can register. The main features of the platform include:

Homepage: This will display the site’s logo, an "About" section, "Privacy" policy, "Terms" of service, "Settings," a login/sign-in button, and a "Contact Support" option.

Site’s Logo: Functionality: Acts as a visual anchor and navigation tool. Clicking the logo usually takes users back to the homepage from any other page on the site. It helps in reinforcing brand identity. About Section: Functionality: Provides context about the site or organization. It’s typically accessed via a link in the navigation menu and helps users understand the purpose and background of the site. Privacy Policy: Functionality: Links to a page detailing how the site handles user data. This is often required by law to inform users about data collection, usage, and protection measures. Terms of Service: Functionality: Links to a document that users must agree to in order to use the site. This includes guidelines and legal obligations related to the use of the site or service. Settings: Functionality: Provides a way for users to customize their experience or manage their account preferences. This might involve adjusting user-specific settings, such as notification preferences or account details. Login/Sign-In Button: Functionality: Redirects users to a login interface where they can enter their credentials to access their account. This is essential for sites that offer personalized content or user-specific services. Contact Support Option: Functionality: Provides a method for users to get assistance or report issues. This links to a contact form, support email allowing users to communicate with customer service or support teams

Post-Login: After logging in, users will be able to view information about each specialist, including their photo and rating (out of 5 stars).

Specialist Profiles: Clicking on a specialist’s profile will direct users to a booking calendar where they can select available times and days to schedule an appointment.
